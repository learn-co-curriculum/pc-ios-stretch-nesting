NESTED DATA STRUCTURES *This material is bonus - think of it as nice-to-have*
+ Dictionaries and Arrays can occur inside of other dictionaries and arrays. Its data structure inception!
+ 
```swift
//nested array:
salad_ingredients = [
      ["romaine", "kale", "spring mix"],
      ["tomatoes", "avocado", "beets"],
      ["vinaigrette", "ranch", "ginger-soy"]
    ]
```
This data would be much better represented as a dictionary (explain why). Can you help me convert it?
```swift
//arrays nested in a dictionary:
  salad_ingredients =[ 
  lettuce: ["romaine", "kale", "spring mix"],
  veggie: ["tomatoes", "avocado", "beets"],
  dressing:["vinagrette", "ranch", "ginger-soy"] 
]
```
